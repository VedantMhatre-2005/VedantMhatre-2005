My name is Vedant Mhatre, and I am a third-year undergraduate student in Computer Engineering at Vivekanand Education Society’s Institute of Technology (VESIT), Mumbai.

My academic interests lie primarily in data science, data analysis, machine learning, and applied research. I approach software development with a research-oriented mindset, deliberately incorporating open-ended and exploratory components into my projects to facilitate further investigation and extension by researchers and practitioners.

I have professional and research experience in applying machine learning to real-world scientific problems. During my internship at VESIT in December 2024, I worked on a machine learning–based project to classify Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs) according to their capacity to absorb atmospheric carbon dioxide, contributing to data-driven material classification efforts. I am particularly interested in the intersection of artificial intelligence with neuroscience and biological sciences, where computational methods can aid in complex pattern discovery and decision-making.

I have also developed a research-driven project in forensic dentistry in collaboration with the Government Dental College & Hospital, Mumbai, focused on matching post-mortem dental radiographs (OPGs and IOPAs) of unidentified victims from mass casualty events with existing ante-mortem dental records to support human identification. This work integrates image processing and machine learning techniques within a sensitive, real-world forensic context.

In addition to technical work, I actively contribute to academic and student communities. I serve as the Public Relations Manager at CodeCell++ VESIT, where I conducted a structured mentorship program in December 2025, and I am an editor in the Newsletter and Public Relations Team of the Computer Engineering Department at VESIT.

Beyond my academic and technical pursuits, I am a bibliophile and writer, with a strong appreciation for literature and reflective writing.
